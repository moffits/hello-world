# hello-world
I'm learning github.
Here is my first branch.
I'm adding stuff to the readme file to see if I can figure out how to make commits.
I also have some future projects in mind I'd like to create git repos for.
It may take some time for my understanding to sink in on how this all works.
Begining the process.
